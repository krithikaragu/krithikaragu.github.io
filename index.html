  Venuganalayam is a Toronto based music academy that has been providing meticulous Carnatic bamboo flute training to students in Canada and overseas. The academy was founded by Dr. Selvanayagam Thayaparan in 1996. Its roots can be traced back a few decades in time and associated with Late Sri Suntharam Selvanayagam from Nallur, Jaffna, Sri Lanka. Late Sri Suntharam Selvanayagam was a decorated flute artist in Sri Lanka, and the Guru and father of Dr. Thayaparan. Venuganalayam adopted his teaching methodology, style and tradition in its current flute training.
