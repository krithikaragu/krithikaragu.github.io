  Venuganalayam is a Toronto-based music academy that has been providing meticulous Carnatic bamboo flute training to students in Canada and overseas and was founded by Dr. Selvanayagam Thayaparan in 1996. The roots of Venuganalayam can be traced back a few decades in time and associated with Late Sri Suntharam Selvanayagam from Nallur, Jaffna, Sri Lanka. … Venuganalayam is paid exclusive tribute for training and staging all the flute Arangetrams to date in Canada.
